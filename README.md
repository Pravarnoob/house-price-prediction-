# 🏠 House Price Prediction using California Housing Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **house prices** using the **California Housing Dataset** with the help of **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The model learns patterns from housing-related features such as income, population, and location to estimate median house values.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The **California Housing Dataset** is based on the 1990 California census data.

### 🔑 Features
- **MedInc** – Median income in block group  
- **HouseAge** – Median house age  
- **AveRooms** – Average number of rooms per household  
- **AveBedrms** – Average number of bedrooms per household  
- **Population** – Population of the block group  
- **AveOccup** – Average number of household members  
- **Latitude** – Latitude of the block group  
- **Longitude** – Longitude of the block group  

### 🎯 Target Variable
- **MedHouseVal** – Median house value (in USD)
